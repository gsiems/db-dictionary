# db-dictionary

A tool for using relational database meta-data to generate data dictionaries.

This is intended as the next generation of https://github.com/gsiems/DataDict with the following differences:
 * Use go instead of perl
 * Just data-dictionaries
 * Default output is static html files

Supported databases are:

 * Postgresql
 * Sqlite
 * MySQL/MariaDB (TODO)
 * Oracle (TODO)
 * MS SQL-Server (TODO)

See [db-dictionary-example](https://github.com/gsiems/db-dictionary-example) for some sample data dictionaries.
